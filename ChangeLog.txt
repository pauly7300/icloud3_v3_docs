Beta 14 - 3/4/2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  iCloud Account Authentication - When the iCloud Account is verified using a password, a session access
    token is created and stored as a cookie. The password login also generates an email saying someone has
    logged into your iCloud account. This beta changes the method of authenticating the account to using
    the token first and then using the password if it has expired. This should eliminate or greatly reduce
    the login emails generated by Apple.
2.  Configuration Wizard > iCloud Account Credentials screen - Updated it to improve readability and make
    it easier to set up the account information. Several rare problems were also fixed where (1) logging
    into an iCloud Account with an incorrect password would still allow access when there was a valid token
    and (2) logging into an iCloud Account with a changed password would not work if the token has expired.
    Now, logging in with a new password causes a new 2fa request to be made.
3.  Zone enter/leave event for an iCloud3 device_tracker entity - This can now be used as an automation
    trigger.
4.  Latitude/longitude values - They are now stored as numeric fields in the device_tracker attributes instead
    of a string field. They are now displayed with 2-decimal places on a Lovelace device_tracker/attributes
    window (an HA limitation). A new gps attribute has been added to display the latitude/longitude with it's
    full precision.
5.  Passive Zones - Fixed a problem where passive zones could be selected. Also found out that the iOS App
    will generate enter/exit triggers for passive zones. These will now be ignored by iCloud3.
6.  Configuration Wizard > Sensors screen - Changed it  for readability and to list the important sensors
    first.
7.  Event Log - Made some minor formatting changes. Also added a new icon to the top-right of the Event Log
    so you can become an iCloud3 Stargazer. Click it to go to the iCloud3_v2 GitHub repository. Then click
    the star in the top-right corner.
8.  Distance Sensors:
    (1) Changed the distance precision so the distance value is within 6-inches/1-millimeter of the
        measurement between the device and the zone center - (4-decimal places for miles, 5 for meters)
    (2) Changed the '_moved_distance' sensor to display in feet/meters when less than 1mi/1km
    (3) Changed the '_moved_distance' to display the distance from one poll to the next when in a zone
    (4) Added attribute to '_moved_distance' to show the from and to location time
    (5) Added attribute to all 'zone_distance' sensors - 'meters_distance' shows the distance in meters
        to the zone with 5-decimal place accuracy
    (6) Added attribute to all 'zone_distance' sensors - 'miles_distance' shows the distance in miles
        to the zone with 4-decimal place accuracy  if the unit_of_measure is miles.



Beta 13 2/21/2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERY IMPORTANT - HA CHANGED THE WAY SENSORS AND DEVICE_TRACKERS ARE SETUP -
THIS UPDATE MUST BE INSTALLED FOR THE 2023.3.1 HA RELEASE

1.  Updated the initilization routines to use the new device_tracker and sensor entity creation methods required by HA
    for the 2023.3.0 release.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Battery entity - The battery sensors are not created if the device only uses the FmF tracking method (FamShr and
    iOSApp are not used). The FmF tracking method does not report battery information.
3.  iCloud Interface - There are 4-steps to set up the iCloud Account interface - Setup, Authentication, FamShr, and FmF.
    Made some changes to this process to better report the steps (in the Event Log) that had not been completed, what was
    in process and what still needed to be done when finalizing the set up process in Stage 4.
4.  Changed the device's Info sensor to add details showing when the device left the Last Zone and arrived at the Current
    Zones:
            At-Home-10:23:00a (2 hrs ago),
            Left-School-3:45:50p (10 mins ago).
    Changed the dir_of_travel sensor for Towards, AwayFrom and InZone to show the zone's name. Examples:
            Towards: `ᗒ Home`, `ᗒ School`,
            AwayFrom: `Home ᗒ`, 'School ᗒ',
            InZone: `@Home`, `@School`
5.  Added options to the way the Device_Tracker state value is set on the Format Settings. It now includes the zone entity
    name, the zone's friendly name, and the iCloud3 reformatted names based on the entity id.
6.  There are some issues with the source of the zone's friendly name. It is stored in the zone definition file
    (.storage/zone) and in the entity registry for the zone. These two areas are sometimes not in sync, particulary when
    the name has been changed. iCloud3 not gets the friendly name from the zone file, not the entity registry.
7.  Fixed a problem with overlaping zones. When a device is in two zones, the smaller one will now be picked.
8.  Changed the Configurator screen on menu page 1 from `Event Log Parameters` to `Format Settings` since that is what it
    really is. Also moved the Event Log directory which never gets changed to the Other Parameters screen.
    THIS WILL REQUIRE A BROWSER REFRESH when using the configuration screen.
9.  Adjusted the distance values when using metric values. The distance is now displayed in meters when it is less
    than 1 km.
10. Fixed a problem when the device could be put into a passive zone. They are still displayed in the Zone's list when
    starting. Now, an indicator shows it is not used.
11. The display option and the device_tracker state values for each zone are displayed in the Event Log during Stage 2
    when starting.
12. Tweaked sone setting in the Event Log card and bumped the version to 3.0.5.
    THIS WILL REQUIRE A BROWSER REFRESH.



Beta 12 2/10/2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  iCloud3 Configurator - The HA 2023.2.2 seems to have disabled the time entry fields (hh:mm:ss) used
    to enter a lot of parameters (inZone Interval, Stationary Still Time, Old Location adjustment, etc).
    The screens display but none of thse fields are showing. This may be a HA bug that needs fixing or
    they are removing it from HA. In any case, all of the configuration parameter entry screens have
    been modified to use another method of entering the parameters. It actually works better, is easier
    to use and takes up less screen real estate. The fields can be entered using the keyboard or through
    a numeric slider.
    THIS WILL REQUIRE A BROWSER REFRESH AFTER DISPLAYING ONE OF THE CONFIGURATOR SCREENS
2.    New 'locate' Service call - Added the 'locate' Action to the icloud3.action Service Call. This action
    lets you locate a device (or all devices) immediately or in after a specific time has elapsed.
    This replaces the set_interval service call in v2.
    The following examples explains how it can be used:
        Calling method:
            service: icloud3.action
            data: {action: locate xx min, device_name: xxx}

        Examples:
            - Locate gary_iphone in 4 minutes: {action: locate 4 min, device_name: gary_iphone}
            - Locate gary_iphone immediately:  {action: locate, device_name: gary_iphone}
            - Locate all phones in 4 minutes:  {action: locate 4 min}
            - Locate all phones immediately:   {action: locate}
2.  Event Log > Action - Added the above 'locate' to the Action command manu to locate a specific device or
    all devices using the FamShr or FmF methods. Also tweaked the debug/rawdata logging text color on the
    heading lines displayed when an update is started or completed. It is now black.
    YOU WILL GET A NOTIFICATION TO REFRESH YOUR BROWSER
3.  Passthru Zone - Tried to fix the problem with the passthru zone enter delay. A device that was
    not using the iOS App (Watch) would set up the passthru zone enter delay when entering a zone but
    the next update time was never getting triggered so the zone enter delay was never be cleared.
    This stopped the device from being tracked and updated. On a trial run, the passthrou zone delay did
    not work but the Watch was tracking without any issues. It is disabled in this beta until I get it
    working and have given it a comprehensive test. It should be available in beta 13 next weekend.


Beta 11 - 2/5/2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Added a Stationary Zone name parameter on the Update iCloud3 Devices parameter screen - Each device
    can now have it's own Stationary Zone friendly name. This overrides the generic friendly name on the
    Special Zones screen for the Stationary Zone.
    NOTE: A BROWSER REFRESH WILL/MAY BE NEEDED IF THE FIELD DOES NOT DISPLAY

    The default name is 'Stationary'. It can be customized on the Special Zones screen to [name]StatZone
    (GarStatZone, LilStatZone). It can now be set by device (GaryZone, LillianZone).
2.  Fixed a problem where 'Stationary' was always used for the device_tracker state for a Stationary Zone
    instead of the friendly name that was set up on the Special Zones/Stationary Zone screen. Also set the
    Stationary Zone state to 0 when it was created so the person counter would work (maybe).
3.  Because of the way iCloud location data is processed, Device updates are handled serially. Only one
    Device can be updated at a time, the next in line must wait until the previous one is complete. The
    method used to control this process was changed to ensure iCloud3 tracking would not hang in up waiting
    for one device update to finish when an unknown error occurred or it was taking a very long time to
    get location data from the iCloud account. Now, everything is reset if one device has been in an
    update process for more than 3-minutes.
    [LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WHERE TRACKING STOPS FOR ALL DEVICES OR ICLOUD3 SEEMS TO BE HUNG UP]
4.  Changed the way the Next Update Time is displayed when the update will be done in 90-secs. For example,
    the time was formatted as '9:35:15a -45s' indicating the update would be done in 45-secs. This will
    break in a future HA release. Now, only the time until the next update will be displayed (45 secs)
    when the update will be done within 90-seconds.
5.  Added a new configuration screen to change the order the devices are tracked and displayed on the
    Event Log. They are processed in the order they were first added to iCloud3 and listed on the iCloud3
    Devices List screen. This new screen lets you change this order. Select `Change Device Order` on the
    iCloud3 Devices List or the Event Log Parameters screens.
6.  If there is an error reading the configuration file when iCloud3 starts, the backup configuration file
    is read and the configuration file with the error is overwritten. The configuration file with the
    error is now saved with a timestamp before it is overwritten.
7.  Fixed a problem where the latitude/longitude values for the Device were not being restored when iCloud3
    was starting. The latitude/longitude was set to 0/0 rather than the last known position, putting it in
    Atlantic Ocean on the equator off the coast of Africa on the HA map until the device's location was
    updated
8.  Fixed the problem where the battery would go from a valye to 0 and back to the value during startup.
    Again. Really, I think I have it this time, no battery = 0 in my debug logs.


Beta 10a - 1/29/2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Fixed a problem in beta 10 that was generating the error message "local variable 'zone_display_as'
    referenced before assignment when entering a zone. This was generated when creating the zone enter
    trigger reason message.

Beta 10 - 1/28/2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Updated the sensor and device_tracker attributes. Added 'sensor_updated' time to all sensors
    to be able to see when a sensor was updated in the Developer Tools > States screen. Removed
    the '_date/time' text from the attribute name for clarity.
2.  Fixed a problem displaying the HA History for sensors showing text values (zone, battery status, etc).
3.  Fixed a problem with more than one device in the Family Sharing List having the same name.
4.  Sometimes, iCloud does not download all of the devices in the Family Sharing account when iCloud3 is
    starting. This leads to a device not found error and requires a restart of iCloud3 and a new request
    to iCloud for the Family Sharing devices. Now, iCloud3 checks to see if all of the configured Family
    Sharing devices and Find-my-Friends devices have been received from iCloud when starting up. If not,
    a retry request is made to iCloud (up to 2 times) before the untrackable devices error message is
    displayed.
5.  The HA standard is to display the device_tracker entity state value/zone name in lower case with
    underscores like entity names ('pizza_hut'). An option has been added to the Event log Parameters configuration
    screen to override this and display the device_tracker state value in the same format as used for
    the Event Log (Pizza Hut, PizzaHut).
6.  Fixed the 'Find my Phone' alert error.
7.  The option to turn off the Passthru Zone and Stationary Zones has been made easier and a message
    is displayed in the Event Log during startup if they are disabled.
8.  Changed the way a NearBy zone is determined to only check tracked devices. It was checking both
    tracked and monitored devices).
9.  The current results of all devices are written to the icloud3-debug.log file every 15-minutes.
    This will help determine the cause of any 'tracking stopped' errors.



Beta 9 - 1/22/2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Fixed a problem selecting several of the Actions from the Configurator.
2.  Fixed a problem where the zone was not being displayed in the _badge sensor and the zone's
    friendly name was not being displayed on the Event Log (and other places) correctly.
3.  Added the Battery Level to the Info sensor for the device. Also fixed a problem getting the
    battery level from the iOS App when the iOS App was reporting a 'not_set' value and  reworked the
    reporting of changes to the battery status (charging, not charging, etc).
4.  Fixed a problem with the v2 --> v3 configuration migration with a message ha_country_code not
    found.
5.  Fixed another problem determing if a near by device's tracking results can be used that was causing
    iCloud3 to hang and stop tracking all devices. The problem was caused by a circular loop where
    A > B > C > D > B > C > D etc. The A, B, C and D are devices that are scanned in sequence to see
    if they are near by and could be used. A check is made, following the path of devices that are
    already being used, trying to find the end. In this case, the end did not exist and iCloud3 died.
    An additional timer check was added to stop liiking after 5-secs.
6.  Added a code to the Near By devices that are not eligible to explain the reason it is not eligible.
    (a-GPS Accuracy, lb-Would Loop Back to itself, sz-Stationary Zone)
7.  Fixed a problem calling the iCloud3 update service with the 'device_name' parameter,
8.  Added the ability to exclude a specific device sensor from being created when iCloud3 started.
    Select Exclude Sensors from the Configurator > Sensors screen, then select the actual sensor to
    be excluded. A Filter can be used to limit the sensors displayed and the Excluded Devices are
    displayed on the Sensors and Exclude Sensors screen. An HA restart is required to complete
    the process.
9.  Fixed a couple of problems with the iCloud Account interface (pyicloud_ic3).
10. The Alert messages generated when iCloud3 is starting are redisplayed in the Event Log when
    the startup process has completed. This summarizes all alerts in one place to help prevent
    then from being missed.
11. Event Log:
        1. Changed the Event Log to better indicate when Debug & Rawdata logging are on. The Debug
        level is now displayed in the tracking results header area in the time field. This also
        shows when it was turned on and off.
        2. Reordered some of the Action items.
        3. Changed some Event Log messages for clarity.
        4. Cleaned up some code.
    REQUIRES A BROWSER REFRESH ON ALL DEVICES


Beta 8 - 1/14/2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Fixed the bug accessing the iCloud3 Devices screen. Again. I hope. It is a timing issue and an
    issue with accessing the iCloud Account through HA. I could make it fail yesterday but not today
    when trying to verify that the new approach fixed it. For those that are having this problem,
    please let me know if you are still having a problem and I'll take another crack at it.
2.  The Waze Route Service is handled by 3-servers around the world - United States/Canada, Israel,
    and the Rest of the World. The HA Country Code is now used to determine that
    the appropriate server is used. It is still shown on the Waze configuration screen for
    information only. It is verified and corrected when HA starts if the wrong server is selected.
3.  Combined the configuration screens for the Waze Route Server and Waze History Database into one
    screen. THIS MAY REQUIRE A BROWSER CACHE REFRESH
4.  Added the 'iCloud3 Theme' that tweeks the field labels in the Configurator so the descriptive
    text is a little more readable (at least for me with my old eyes). It has both a light and dark
    mode and only a few entries. You can find the it in config/custom_components/icloud3/theme.

    Move the 'iCloud3 Theme' from the 'icloud3/theme' folder to the 'config/themes' folder.
    (1) If you are already using a theme, copy the 'icloud3_theme.yaml' file statements (both the
        light and dark mode) into the appropriate location in your theme's yaml file. Then restart HA.
    (2) If you are not using a theme, restart HA, open your Profile screen, then select 'iCloud3 Theme'
    on the Themes list.

    I used it when capturing screenshots for the iCloud3 documentation.
5.  Fixed a number of problems with the battery and battery status sensors. (1) It was being updated
    by the iOS App every 15-minutes instead of every 5-seconds. (2) The value was resetting to 0 when
    HA or iCloud3 restarted instead of restoring it's value from the last update. (3) It was not being
    updated when iCloud3 restarted until the next poll, which may be 2-hours if you are in a zone.
    (4) It was only being saved to the restore_state file on the next poll, not the value when it
    changed in the iOS App. Again, if you are in a zone, the value might be 2-hours old from the last
    iCloud update, leading to drops and spikes in the battery sensor in the HA history.
6.  Fixed a problem that might cause iCloud3 to hang when you are tracking 2 or more devices and they
    are all close to eack other. The problem occured when device A was using device B tracking results
    (distance, travel time, next update time, etc), B was using C, and C was using A. This created a
    circular loop so every device used the same data and a new update was never done.
7.  Addressed a problem building the picture file list for the iCloud3 Devices screen. I can not
    reproduce the error but changed some code so the error being encountered would not occur.


Beta 7 - 1/8/2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Fixed a problem connecting to the iCloud Account when there was a delay establishing the
    initial connection. This was causing authentication delays and eventually creating an HA
    error about I/O being done outside of the Event Loop. Also added a configuration item to
    delay setting up the iCloud connection untill later in the iCloud start up process.
2.  Removed the unit of measure (mi, km) from the distance sensor distance related attributes.
    They are now numeric values, making it much simpler to use in automation triggers and conditions.
3.  Fixed a problem where the Max Distance attribute in the distance sensors was being set when the
    location was old or the gps accuracy was poor. An additional check was added to only set the
    max_distance when the interval is >= 1-minute
4.  Added the distance to other devices to _zone_distance sensor and _home_distance sensors. It
    displays the distance in meters and miles or kilometers. Each device has it's own attribute
    that is available in automations and scripts. Since the underscore ('_') can not be displayed
    in an attribute (HA limitation), the underscores ('_'s) have been converted to dashes ('-'s).
5.  Modified the way nearby device information is reported and used to make it more reliable and
    easier to display in the Event Log.
6.  Fixed a problem where iCloud3 would hang if the Waze Region code was not appropriate for your
    location. Also, the HA location country code is used to determine the correct Waze Region when
    the conversion is done or iCloud3 is being installed for the first time.
7.  Fixed a few problems with the icloud3-debug.log where debug logging would be stopped when it
    shouldn't have and where the file would not always be created when iCloud3 started. Also reduced
    time ensuring records are written to the file from 15-minutes to 1-minute

Beta 6 - 12/30/2022
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Corrected a mispelled directory name used for installing sample device images (ipad.png, watch.png).
    The image directory nane was 'event_log_cad'. It should be 'event_log_card'.
2.  A new icloud3-debug.log file will now be created when restarting iCloud3 from the Event Log or when
    HA was started and the log level is debug. New records will be added to the existing log file when
    debug is started from Event Log > Actions and the log file is less than 20-hours old.
3.  Fixed a problem where location data from iCloud FamShr/FmF was not always being rejected due to poor
    gps_accuracy. This could lead to location & zone errors until the next locate was processed.
4.  Improved the performance displaying the results of the Initial Device Locate results in the Event Log.
5.  The Event Log for the selected devices is automatically refreshed when new information is added. The
    number of items was increased from 15 to 50 so more events are displayed without refreshing.
6.  Added a prefilter to the rawdata debug log to make sure usernames & passwords are not displayed.
7.  Some internal code cleanup and minor tweaking.


Beta 5 - 12/28/2022
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Fixed a 'log_info_msg' not defined error message in the routine that identifies the notify
    service  used for a device. This is just an informative message indicating HA has not set it
    up yet.
2.  Periodically, the events currently displayed for a device is reduced from all events to less
    than a screen. This number was increased from 1/2-screen to about 2-screens.
3.  When the displayed events for a device were reduced (#2 above), the screen was never refreshed
    so you would always see the old events and had to do a refresh to see the latest events. Now,
    the device's events are automatically refreshed when they are updated.
4.  Updated the Event Log Lovelace card to v3.0.1. This fixes a problem when the date/time should not
    be displayed if there was an alert message was displayed.


Beta 4 - 12/27/2022
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Inactive/Untracked devices are listed at the end of the Startup Event Log messages.
2.  Fixed some problems displaying the EVent Log when there were no devices to track.
3.  Fixed problem dealing with Gb.ic3_debug_log_write_secs variable not found.
4.  Fixed problem where the Event Log records were not displayed in a timely manner when starting.
5.  The tracking results written to the Log file now include the zone, distance and time values.
6.  Reworked the icloud3-debug.log file:
        - A new file is created when:
            - HA/iCloud3 starts and the Log Level is debug or rawdata or
            - Starting Debug Logging from Event Log > Actions or
            - At midnight when debug logging is on and the file is more thn 20-hours old.
        - Otherwise debug records are added to the existing Debug Log file.
        - If the Log Level is debug or rawdata in the Configurator > Event Log parameters and
          Stop Debug Logging was selected on Event Log > Actions, the configuration will be changed
          to 'info' (no debug logging).
        - If the configuration is set to 'info' (no debug logging) and it is started on
          Event Log > Actions, the configuration is not updated and the debug logging will remain
          on until midnight, the next iCloud3 restart or when it is turned off.


QUESTION: Currently the Exported Event Log file contains the date/time indicating when it was created.
          This creates a new file for every export.
                Example: 'icloud3-event-log_2022-12-26 18:00:00.log'
          Another option is to not have the date/time in the file name so a new Export overrites
          the last one.
                Example: 'icloud3-event-log.log'

          Does anyone have an opinion on this.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Beta 3 - 12/24/2022
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Fixed a problem where the Configurator > Sensors would generate an 'Unknown Error Ocurred'
    error message. This was caused by an invalid sensor field name ('tracking_from_zones')
    in the configuration file.
2.  Fixed a problem on the Configurator > Sensors screen dealing with an invalid 'battery_status'
    error message.
3.  Fixed a problem where error messages were displayed getting device info from the HA device
    registry when the device was not in the registry.
4.  Fixed a problem displaying the obscured email address if there was more than one @-sign
    in the address.
5.  Added 'Reinitialize All Devices' to the Configurator > iCloud3 Devices screen. With it,
    you can remove all devices from iCloud3 or reset the selections for the iCloud FamShr & FmF
    and the iOS App parameters to `None`. This will clear any errors due to device migration errors.
6.  Setting up the log_level (info, debug, rawdata) a lot earlier. It is now setup when HA loads
    iCloud3 instead of later. Debug and RawData information should now be written to the HA Log file
    (home-assistant.log) when the iCloud Account connection is first established.
7.  Moved `Event Log Configuration` option to Menu Page 1 and moved `Display Text As` option to Menu
    Page 2. Also added the `Log Level` parameter to the Event Log Configuration screen. This
    will reduce the steps needed to change the Log Level parameter when debug/rawdata logging
    is desired. ---> YOU MAY NEED TO REFRESH YOUR BROWSER WITH THE CONFIGURATOR OPEN <---
8.  Fixed problem changing the devices Friendly Name that would generate an error message deleting
    tracking_from_zone sensors when they had not been created.
9.  The device_tracker state value is now lower-case.
10. Log level debug and rawdata records are now written to the '/config/icloud3_debug.log' file
    instead of the HA log file. A new file is created every time HA starts.
11. The file extension for the Event Log file was changed from '.txt' to '.log'. The file name is
    now 'icloud3-event-log_[time].log'.
12. Fixed problem displaying the Event Log when no devices had been configured.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Beta 2 - 12/17/2022
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Do not display an error messgage when trying to get the model of a device if t is
    not in the HA device registry. (entity_io:137)
2.  Fix a problem checking if info for all of configured devices that had been set
    up had been returned from iCloud account during startup. If not, the FmF devices
    were being refreshed when it should be refreshing the FamShr devices. (start_ic3:1315)
3.  Fixed an error copying the Event Log image sample files to the custom cards directory.
    It was copyingthe files from 'event_log' instead of 'event_log_card'. (start_ic3:722)
4.  Added 'Erase All Devices' to the Configuration > Action menu that will reinitialize the
    iCloud3 Devices List.
5.  The Time Format (12/24-hour) was converted incorrectly. It was creating '12/24-hour-hour'
    This has been fixed and the invalid parameter in the configuration file was corrrected.
6.  Fixed a problem where a check was being made to see if 2fa authentication was needed when
    the connection to the iCloud Location Services had not been completed, causing a problem
